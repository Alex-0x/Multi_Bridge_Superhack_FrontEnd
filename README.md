# Multi_Bridge_Superhack_FrontEnd

Welcome to the Multi_Bridge_Superhack repository, this project has been specifically created for Ethglobal's Superhack and utilizes Chainlink's CCIP protocol for linking between Ethereum's layer 1 and layer 2. In this initial phase, the linking is limited to the testnet environment.

The project structure is organized into two main folders:

**multi_bridge_fe (Front-End):** This folder contains the code for the front-end part of the application. 

**MultiBridge_sk (Smart Contracts):** This folder will house the files related to the smart contracts of the project. However, this folder is located in a separate repository. You can find this part of the code at the following address: [https://github.com/Alex-0x/Multi_Bridge_Superhack](https://github.com/Alex-0x/Multi_Bridge_Superhack).
